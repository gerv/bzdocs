<p>This section contains information for end-users of Bugzilla.  There
is a Bugzilla test installation, called
<a class="reference external" href="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/">Landfill</a>, which you are
welcome to play with (if it&#8217;s up). However, not all of the Bugzilla
installations there will necessarily have all Bugzilla features enabled,
and different installations run different versions, so some things may not
quite work as this document describes.</p>
<p>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) are available and answered on
<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:FAQ">wiki.mozilla.org</a>.
They may cover some questions you have which are left unanswered.</p>

<p>If you want to use Bugzilla, first you need to create an account.
Consult with the administrator responsible for your installation of
Bugzilla for the URL you should use to access it. If you&#8217;re
test-driving Bugzilla, use this URL:
<a class="reference external" href="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/">http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/</a>.</p>

<p class="last">Also, if only some users are allowed to create an account on

prevent users from abusing the generation of user accounts, for
instance by entering inexistent email addresses, or email addresses
which do not belong to them.</p>

<span id="bug-page"></span><h2>Anatomy of a Bug<a class="headerlink" href="#anatomy-of-a-bug" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The core of Bugzilla is the screen which displays a particular
bug. It&#8217;s a good place to explain some Bugzilla concepts.
<a class="reference external" href="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/show_bug.cgi?id=1">Bug 1 on Landfill</a></p>
<p>is a good example. Note that the labels for most fields are hyperlinks;
clicking them will take you to context-sensitive help on that
particular field. Fields marked * may not be present on every
installation of Bugzilla.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><em>Product and Component</em>:
Bugs are divided up by Product and Component, with a Product
having one or more Components in it. For example,
bugzilla.mozilla.org&#8217;s &#8220;Bugzilla&#8221; Product is composed of several
Components:

<div class="section" id="searching-for-bugs">
<span id="query"></span><h2>Searching for Bugs<a class="headerlink" href="#searching-for-bugs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Bugzilla Search page is the interface where you can find
any bug report, comment, or patch currently in the Bugzilla system. You
can play with it here:
<a class="reference external" href="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/query.cgi">http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/query.cgi</a>.</p>
<p>The Search page has controls for selecting different possible
values for all of the fields in a bug, as described above. For some
fields, multiple values can be selected. In those cases, Bugzilla
returns bugs where the content of the field matches any one of the selected
values. If none is selected, then the field can take any value.</p>
<p>After a search is run, you can save it as a Saved Search, which
will appear in the page footer. If you are in the group defined
by the &#8220;querysharegroup&#8221; parameter, you may share your queries
with other users, see <a class="reference internal" href="#savedsearches"><em>Saved Searches</em></a> for more details.</p>
<div class="section" id="boolean-charts">
<span id="boolean"></span><h3>Boolean Charts<a class="headerlink" href="#boolean-charts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Highly advanced querying is done using Boolean Charts.</p>
<p>The boolean charts further restrict the set of results
returned by a query. It is possible to search for bugs
based on elaborate combinations of criteria.</p>
<p>The simplest boolean searches have only one term. These searches
permit the selected left <em>field</em>
to be compared using a
selectable <em>operator</em> to a
specified <em>value.</em>
Using the &#8220;And,&#8221; &#8220;Or,&#8221; and &#8220;Add Another Boolean Chart&#8221; buttons,
additional terms can be included in the query, further
altering the list of bugs returned by the query.</p>
<p>There are three fields in each row of a boolean search.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Field:</em>
the items being searched</li>
<li><em>Operator:</em>
the comparison operator</li>
<li><em>Value:</em>
the value to which the field is being compared</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="pronoun-substitution">
<span id="pronouns"></span><h4>Pronoun Substitution<a class="headerlink" href="#pronoun-substitution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sometimes, a query needs to compare a user-related field
(such as ReportedBy) with a role-specific user (such as the
user running the query or the user to whom each bug is assigned).
When the operator is either &#8220;equals&#8221; or &#8220;notequals&#8221;, the value
can be &#8220;%reporter%&#8221;, &#8220;%assignee%&#8221;, &#8220;%qacontact%&#8221;, or &#8220;%user%&#8221;.
The user pronoun
refers to the user who is executing the query or, in the case
of whining reports, the user who will be the recipient
of the report. The reporter, assignee, and qacontact
pronouns refer to the corresponding fields in the bug.</p>
<p>Boolean charts also let you type a group name in any user-related
field if the operator is either &#8220;equals&#8221;, &#8220;notequals&#8221; or &#8220;anyexact&#8221;.
This will let you query for any member belonging (or not) to the
specified group. The group name must be entered following the
&#8220;%group.foo%&#8221; syntax, where &#8220;foo&#8221; is the group name.
So if you are looking for bugs reported by any user being in the
&#8220;editbugs&#8221; group, then you can type &#8220;%group.editbugs%&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="negation">
<span id="id17"></span><h4>Negation<a class="headerlink" href="#negation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>At first glance, negation seems redundant. Rather than
searching for</p>
<blockquote>
<div>NOT(&#8220;summary&#8221; &#8220;contains the string&#8221; &#8220;foo&#8221;),</div></blockquote>
<p>one could search for</p>
<blockquote>
<div>(&#8220;summary&#8221; &#8220;does not contain the string&#8221; &#8220;foo&#8221;).</div></blockquote>
<p>However, the search</p>
<blockquote>
<div>(&#8220;CC&#8221; &#8220;does not contain the string&#8221; &#8220;&#64;mozilla.org&#8221;)</div></blockquote>
<p>would find every bug where anyone on the CC list did not contain
&#8220;&#64;mozilla.org&#8221; while</p>
<blockquote>
<div>NOT(&#8220;CC&#8221; &#8220;contains the string&#8221; &#8220;&#64;mozilla.org&#8221;)</div></blockquote>
<p>would find every bug where there was nobody on the CC list who
did contain the string. Similarly, the use of negation also permits
complex expressions to be built using terms OR&#8217;d together and then
negated. Negation permits queries such as</p>
<blockquote>
<div>NOT((&#8220;product&#8221; &#8220;equals&#8221; &#8220;update&#8221;) OR
(&#8220;component&#8221; &#8220;equals&#8221; &#8220;Documentation&#8221;))</div></blockquote>
<p>to find bugs that are neither
in the update product or in the documentation component or</p>
<blockquote>
<div>NOT((&#8220;commenter&#8221; &#8220;equals&#8221; &#8220;%assignee%&#8221;) OR
(&#8220;component&#8221; &#8220;equals&#8221; &#8220;Documentation&#8221;))</div></blockquote>
<p>to find non-documentation
bugs on which the assignee has never commented.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="multiple-charts">
<span id="multiplecharts"></span><h4>Multiple Charts<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-charts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The terms within a single row of a boolean chart are all
constraints on a single piece of data. If you are looking for
a bug that has two different people cc&#8217;d on it, then you need
to use two boolean charts. A search for</p>
<blockquote>
<div>(&#8220;cc&#8221; &#8220;contains the string&#8221; &#8220;foo&#64;&#8221;) AND
(&#8220;cc&#8221; &#8220;contains the string&#8221; &#8220;&#64;mozilla.org&#8221;)</div></blockquote>
<p>would return only bugs with &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:foo&#37;&#52;&#48;mozilla&#46;org">foo<span>&#64;</span>mozilla<span>&#46;</span>org</a>&#8221; on the cc list.
If you wanted bugs where there is someone on the cc list
containing &#8220;foo&#64;&#8221; and someone else containing &#8220;&#64;mozilla.org&#8221;,
then you would need two boolean charts.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>First chart: (&#8220;cc&#8221; &#8220;contains the string&#8221; &#8220;foo&#64;&#8221;)
Second chart: (&#8220;cc&#8221; &#8220;contains the string&#8221; &#8220;&#64;mozilla.org&#8221;)</div></blockquote>
<p>The bugs listed will be only the bugs where ALL the charts are true.</p>

<div class="section" id="quicksearch">
<span id="id18"></span><h3>Quicksearch<a class="headerlink" href="#quicksearch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Quicksearch is a single-text-box query tool which uses
metacharacters to indicate what is to be searched. For example, typing
&#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo|bar</span></tt>&#8221;
into Quicksearch would search for &#8220;foo&#8221; or &#8220;bar&#8221; in the
summary and status whiteboard of a bug; adding
&#8220;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">:BazProduct</span></tt>&#8221; would
search only in that product.
You can use it to find a bug by its number or its alias, too.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find the Quicksearch box in Bugzilla&#8217;s footer area.
On Bugzilla&#8217;s front page, there is an additional
<a class="reference external" href="../../page.cgi?id=quicksearch.html">Help</a>
link which details how to use it.</p>

<div class="section" id="case-sensitivity-in-searches">
<span id="casesensitivity"></span><h3>Case Sensitivity in Searches<a class="headerlink" href="#case-sensitivity-in-searches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bugzilla queries are case-insensitive and accent-insensitive, when
used with either MySQL or Oracle databases. When using Bugzilla with
PostgreSQL, however, some queries are case-sensitive. This is due to
the way PostgreSQL handles case and accent sensitivity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bug-lists">
<span id="list"></span><h3>Bug Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-lists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you run a search, a list of matching bugs will be returned.</p>
<p>The format of the list is configurable. For example, it can be
sorted by clicking the column headings. Other useful features can be
accessed using the links at the bottom of the list:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Long Format:</dt>
<dd>this gives you a large page with a non-editable summary of the fields

<dt>XML:</dt>
<dd>get the buglist in the XML format.</dd>
<dt>CSV:</dt>
<dd>get the buglist as comma-separated values, for import into e.g.
a spreadsheet.</dd>
<dt>Feed:</dt>
<dd>get the buglist as an Atom feed.  Copy this link into your
favorite feed reader.  If you are using Firefox, you can also
save the list as a live bookmark by clicking the live bookmark
icon in the status bar.  To limit the number of bugs in the feed,
add a limit=n parameter to the URL.</dd>
<dt>iCalendar:</dt>
<dd>Get the buglist as an iCalendar file. Each bug is represented as a
to-do item in the imported calendar.</dd>
<dt>Change Columns:</dt>
<dd>change the bug attributes which appear in the list.</dd>
<dt>Change several bugs at once:</dt>
<dd>If your account is sufficiently empowered, and more than one bug
appear in the bug list, this link is displayed which lets you make
the same change to all the bugs in the list - for example, changing
their assignee.</dd>
<dt>Send mail to bug assignees:</dt>
<dd>If more than one bug appear in the bug list and there are at least
two distinct bug assignees, this links is displayed which lets you
easily send a mail to the assignees of all bugs on the list.</dd>
<dt>Edit Search:</dt>
<dd>If you didn&#8217;t get exactly the results you were looking for, you can

<span id="individual-buglists"></span><h3>Adding/removing tags to/from bugs<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-removing-tags-to-from-bugs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can add and remove tags from individual bugs, which let you find and
manage bugs more easily. Tags are per-user and so are only visible and editable
by the user who created them. You can then run queries using tags as a criteria,
either by using the Advanced Search form, or simply by typing &#8220;<a class="reference external" href="tag:my_tag_name">tag:my_tag_name</a>&#8221;
in the QuickSearch box at the top (or bottom) of the page. Tags can also be
displayed in buglists.</p>
<p>This feature is useful when you want to keep track of several bugs, but
for different reasons. Instead of adding yourself to the CC list of all
these bugs and mixing all these reasons, you can now store these bugs in
separate lists, e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Keep</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">mind</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Interesting</span> <span class="pre">bugs</span></tt>,
or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Triage</span></tt>. One big advantage of this way to manage bugs
is that you can easily add or remove tags from bugs one by one.</p>

<div class="section" id="reporting-a-new-bug">
<span id="fillingbugs"></span><h3>Reporting a New Bug<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-a-new-bug" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Years of bug writing experience has been distilled for your
reading pleasure into the
<a class="reference external" href="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html">Bug Writing Guidelines</a>.
While some of the advice is Mozilla-specific, the basic principles of
reporting Reproducible, Specific bugs, isolating the Product you are
using, the Version of the Product, the Component which failed, the
Hardware Platform, and Operating System you were using at the time of
the failure go a long way toward ensuring accurate, responsible fixes
for the bug that bit you.</p>
<p>The procedure for filing a bug is as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Click the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">New</span></tt> link available in the footer
of pages, or the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">new</span> <span class="pre">bug</span> <span class="pre">report</span></tt> link
displayed on the home page of the Bugzilla installation.
.. note:: If you want to file a test bug to see how Bugzilla works,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>you can do it on one of our test installations on
<a class="reference external" href="http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/">Landfill</a>.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You first have to select the product in which you found a bug.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You now see a form where you can specify the component (part of
the product which is affected by the bug you discovered; if you have
no idea, just select <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">General</span></tt> if such a component exists),
the version of the program you were using, the Operating System and
platform your program is running on and the severity of the bug (if the
bug you found crashes the program, it&#8217;s probably a major or a critical
bug; if it&#8217;s a typo somewhere, that&#8217;s something pretty minor; if it&#8217;s
something you would like to see implemented, then that&#8217;s an enhancement).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You now have to give a short but descriptive summary of the bug you found.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">My</span> <span class="pre">program</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">crashing</span> <span class="pre">all</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">time</span></tt> is a very poor summary
and doesn&#8217;t help developers at all. Try something more meaningful or
your bug will probably be ignored due to a lack of precision.
The next step is to give a very detailed list of steps to reproduce
the problem you encountered. Try to limit these steps to a minimum set
required to reproduce the problem. This will make the life of
developers easier, and the probability that they consider your bug in
a reasonable timeframe will be much higher.
.. note:: Try to make sure that everything in the summary is also in the first</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>comment. Summaries are often updated and this will ensure your original
information is easily accessible.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">As you file the bug, you can also attach a document (testcase, patch,
or screenshot of the problem).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Depending on the Bugzilla installation you are using and the product in
which you are filing the bug, you can also request developers to consider
your bug in different ways (such as requesting review for the patch you
just attached, requesting your bug to block the next release of the
product, and many other product specific requests).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Now is a good time to read your bug report again. Remove all misspellings,
otherwise your bug may not be found by developers running queries for some
specific words, and so your bug would not get any attention.
Also make sure you didn&#8217;t forget any important information developers
should know in order to reproduce the problem, and make sure your
description of the problem is explicit and clear enough.
When you think your bug report is ready to go, the last step is to
click the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Commit</span></tt> button to add your report into the database.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You do not need to put &#8220;any&#8221; or similar strings in the URL field.
If there is no specific URL associated with the bug, leave this
field blank.</p>
<p>If you feel a bug you filed was incorrectly marked as a
DUPLICATE of another, please question it in your bug, not
the bug it was duped to. Feel free to CC the person who duped it
if they are not already CCed.</p>

<div class="section" id="clone-an-existing-bug">
<span id="cloningbugs"></span><h3>Clone an Existing Bug<a class="headerlink" href="#clone-an-existing-bug" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Starting with version 2.20, Bugzilla has a feature that allows you
to clone an existing bug. The newly created bug will inherit
most settings from the old bug. This allows you to track more
easily similar concerns in a new bug. To use this, go to the bug
that you want to clone, then click the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Clone</span> <span class="pre">This</span> <span class="pre">Bug</span></tt>
link on the bug page. This will take you to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Enter</span> <span class="pre">Bug</span></tt>
page that is filled with the values that the old bug has.
You can change those values and/or texts if needed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attachments">
<span id="id20"></span><h2>Attachments<a class="headerlink" href="#attachments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You should use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII
data, such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it
doesn&#8217;t bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause people to
receive fat, useless mails.</p>
<p>You should make sure to trim screenshots. There&#8217;s no need to show the
whole screen if you are pointing out a single-pixel problem.</p>
<p>Bugzilla stores and uses a Content-Type for each attachment
(e.g. text/html). To download an attachment as a different
Content-Type (e.g. application/xhtml+xml), you can override this
using a &#8216;content_type&#8217; parameter on the URL, e.g.
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">&amp;content_type=text/plain</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Also, you can enter the URL pointing to the attachment instead of
uploading the attachment itself. For example, this is useful if you want to
point to an external application, a website or a very large file. Note that
there is no guarantee that the source file will always be available, nor
that its content will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Another way to attach data is to paste text directly in the text field,
and Bugzilla will convert it into an attachment. This is pretty useful
when you do copy and paste, and you don&#8217;t want to put the text in a temporary
file first.</p>
<div class="section" id="patch-viewer">
<span id="patchviewer"></span><h3>Patch Viewer<a class="headerlink" href="#patch-viewer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Viewing and reviewing patches in Bugzilla is often difficult due to
lack of context, improper format and the inherent readability issues that
raw patches present.  Patch Viewer is an enhancement to Bugzilla designed
to fix that by offering increased context, linking to sections, and
integrating with Bonsai, LXR and CVS.</p>
<p>Patch viewer allows you to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>View patches in color, with side-by-side view rather than trying
to interpret the contents of the patch.</li>
<li>See the difference between two patches.</li>
<li>Get more context in a patch.</li>
<li>Collapse and expand sections of a patch for easy
reading.</li>
<li>Link to a particular section of a patch for discussion or
review</li>
<li>Go to Bonsai or LXR to see more context, blame, and
cross-references for the part of the patch you are looking at</li>
<li>Create a rawtext unified format diff out of any patch, no
matter what format it came from</li>
</ul>

<span id="patchviewer-view"></span><h4>Viewing Patches in Patch Viewer<a class="headerlink" href="#viewing-patches-in-patch-viewer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The main way to view a patch in patch viewer is to click on the
&#8220;Diff&#8221; link next to a patch in the Attachments list on a bug. You may
also do this within the edit window by clicking the &#8220;View Attachment As
Diff&#8221; button in the Edit Attachment screen.</p>

<span id="patchviewer-diff"></span><h4>Seeing the Difference Between Two Patches<a class="headerlink" href="#seeing-the-difference-between-two-patches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To see the difference between two patches, you must first view the
newer patch in Patch Viewer.  Then select the older patch from the
dropdown at the top of the page (&#8220;Differences between [dropdown] and
this patch&#8221;) and click the &#8220;Diff&#8221; button. This will show you what

<span id="patchviewer-context"></span><h4>Getting More Context in a Patch<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-more-context-in-a-patch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To get more context in a patch, you put a number in the textbox at
the top of Patch Viewer (&#8220;Patch / File / [textbox]&#8221;) and hit enter.
This will give you that many lines of context before and after each
change. Alternatively, you can click on the &#8220;File&#8221; link there and it
will show each change in the full context of the file. This feature only
works against files that were diffed using &#8220;cvs diff&#8221;.</p>

patch is absolutely huge and you want to only review part of it at a
time), you can click the &#8220;(+)&#8221; and &#8220;(-)&#8221; links next to each file (to
expand it or collapse it). If you want to collapse all files or expand

<p>To link to a section of a patch (for example, if you want to be
able to give someone a URL to show them which part you are talking
about) you simply click the &#8220;Link Here&#8221; link on the section header. The

<p>To go to Bonsai to get blame for the lines you are interested in,
you can click the &#8220;Lines XX-YY&#8221; link on the section header you are
interested in. This works even if the patch is against an old
version of the file, since Bonsai stores all versions of the file.</p>
<p>To go to LXR, you click on the filename on the file header
(unfortunately, since LXR only does the most recent version, line

<div class="section" id="hints-and-tips">
<span id="hintsandtips"></span><h2>Hints and Tips<a class="headerlink" href="#hints-and-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section distills some Bugzilla tips and best practices
that have been developed.</p>
<div class="section" id="autolinkification">
<h3>Autolinkification<a class="headerlink" href="#autolinkification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bugzilla comments are plain text - so typing &lt;U&gt; will
produce less-than, U, greater-than rather than underlined text.
However, Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain
sorts of text in comments. For example, the text
&#8220;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bugzilla.org">http://www.bugzilla.org</a>&#8221; will be turned into a link:
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bugzilla.org">http://www.bugzilla.org</a>.
Other strings which get linkified in the obvious manner are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>bug 12345</li>
<li>comment 7</li>
<li>bug 23456, comment 53</li>
<li>attachment 4321</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="mailto:george&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;com">mailto:george<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>com</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="mailto:george&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;com">george<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>com</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org">ftp://ftp.mozilla.org</a></li>
<li>Most other sorts of URL</li>
</ul>
<p>A corollary here is that if you type a bug number in a comment,
you should put the word &#8220;bug&#8221; before it, so it gets autolinkified
for the convenience of others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comments">
<span id="commenting"></span><h3>Comments<a class="headerlink" href="#comments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are changing the fields on a bug, only comment if
either you have something pertinent to say, or Bugzilla requires it.
Otherwise, you may spam people unnecessarily with bug mail.
To take an example: a user can set up their account to filter out messages
where someone just adds themselves to the CC field of a bug
(which happens a lot.) If you come along, add yourself to the CC field,
and add a comment saying &#8220;Adding self to CC&#8221;, then that person
gets a pointless piece of mail they would otherwise have avoided.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use sigs in comments. Signing your name (&#8220;Bill&#8221;) is acceptable,
if you do it out of habit, but full mail/news-style
four line ASCII art creations are not.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="server-side-comment-wrapping">
<span id="comment-wrapping"></span><h3>Server-Side Comment Wrapping<a class="headerlink" href="#server-side-comment-wrapping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bugzilla stores comments unwrapped and wraps them at display time. This
ensures proper wrapping in all browsers. Lines beginning with the &#8220;&gt;&#8221;
character are assumed to be quotes, and are not wrapped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dependency-tree">
<span id="dependencytree"></span><h3>Dependency Tree<a class="headerlink" href="#dependency-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>On the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dependency</span> <span class="pre">tree</span></tt> page linked from each bug
page, you can see the dependency relationship from the bug as a
tree structure.</p>
<p>You can change how much depth to show, and you can hide resolved bugs
from this page. You can also collaps/expand dependencies for
each bug on the tree view, using the [-]/[+] buttons that appear
before its summary. This option is not available for terminal
bugs in the tree (that don&#8217;t have further dependencies).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-tracking-information">
<span id="timetracking"></span><h2>Time Tracking Information<a class="headerlink" href="#time-tracking-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Users who belong to the group specified by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">timetrackinggroup</span></tt>
parameter have access to time-related fields. Developers can see
deadlines and estimated times to fix bugs, and can provide time spent
on these bugs. Users who do not belong to this group can only see the deadline,
but not edit it. Other time-related fields remain invisible to them.</p>
<p>At any time, a summary of the time spent by developers on bugs is
accessible either from bug lists when clicking the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Time</span> <span class="pre">Summary</span></tt>
button or from individual bugs when clicking the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Summarize</span> <span class="pre">time</span></tt>
link in the time tracking table. The <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">summarize_time.cgi</span></tt>
page lets you view this information either per developer or per bug,
and can be split on a month basis to have greater details on how time
is spent by developers.</p>
<p>As soon as a bug is marked as RESOLVED, the remaining time expected
to fix the bug is set to zero. This lets QA people set it again for
their own usage, and it will be set to zero again when the bug will
be marked as CLOSED.</p>

<p>Bugzilla has a feature called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Users</span> <span class="pre">Watching</span></tt>.
When you enter one or more comma-delineated user accounts (usually email

bugmail those users are sent (security settings permitting).
This powerful functionality enables seamless transitions as developers
change projects or users go on holiday.</p>

<div class="section" id="reports-and-charts">
<span id="reporting"></span><h2>Reports and Charts<a class="headerlink" href="#reports-and-charts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As well as the standard buglist, Bugzilla has two more ways of
viewing sets of bugs. These are the reports (which give different
views of the current state of the database) and charts (which plot
the changes in particular sets of bugs over time.)</p>
<div class="section" id="reports">
<span id="id21"></span><h3>Reports<a class="headerlink" href="#reports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A report is a view of the current state of the bug database.</p>
<p>You can run either an HTML-table-based report, or a graphical
line/pie/bar-chart-based one. The two have different pages to
define them, but are close cousins - once you&#8217;ve defined and
viewed a report, you can switch between any of the different
views of the data at will.</p>
<p>Both report types are based on the idea of defining a set of bugs
using the standard search interface, and then choosing some
aspect of that set to plot on the horizontal and/or vertical axes.
You can also get a form of 3-dimensional report by choosing to have
multiple images or tables.</p>
<p>So, for example, you could use the search form to choose &#8220;all
bugs in the WorldControl product&#8221;, and then plot their severity
against their component to see which component had had the largest
number of bad bugs reported against it.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve defined your parameters and hit &#8220;Generate Report&#8221;,
you can switch between HTML, CSV, Bar, Line and Pie. (Note: Pie
is only available if you didn&#8217;t define a vertical axis, as pie
charts don&#8217;t have one.) The other controls are fairly self-explanatory;
you can change the size of the image if you find text is overwriting
other text, or the bars are too thin to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="charts">
<span id="id22"></span><h3>Charts<a class="headerlink" href="#charts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A chart is a view of the state of the bug database over time.</p>
<p>Bugzilla currently has two charting systems - Old Charts and New
Charts. Old Charts have been part of Bugzilla for a long time; they
chart each status and resolution for each product, and that&#8217;s all.
They are deprecated, and going away soon - we won&#8217;t say any more
about them.
New Charts are the future - they allow you to chart anything you
can define as a search.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Both charting forms require the administrator to set up the
data-gathering script. If you can&#8217;t see any charts, ask them whether
they have done so.</p>
</div>
<p>An individual line on a chart is called a data set.
All data sets are organised into categories and subcategories. The
data sets that Bugzilla defines automatically use the Product name
as a Category and Component names as Subcategories, but there is no
need for you to follow that naming scheme with your own charts if
you don&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>Data sets may be public or private. Everyone sees public data sets in
the list, but only their creator sees private data sets. Only
administrators can make data sets public.
No two data sets, even two private ones, can have the same set of
category, subcategory and name. So if you are creating private data
sets, one idea is to have the Category be your username.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-charts">
<h4>Creating Charts<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-charts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>You create a chart by selecting a number of data sets from the
list, and pressing Add To List for each. In the List Of Data Sets
To Plot, you can define the label that data set will have in the
chart&#8217;s legend, and also ask Bugzilla to Sum a number of data sets
(e.g. you could Sum data sets representing RESOLVED, VERIFIED and
CLOSED in a particular product to get a data set representing all
the resolved bugs in that product.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve erroneously added a data set to the list, select it
using the checkbox and click Remove. Once you add more than one
data set, a &#8220;Grand Total&#8221; line
automatically appears at the bottom of the list. If you don&#8217;t want
this, simply remove it as you would remove any other line.</p>
<p>You may also choose to plot only over a certain date range, and
to cumulate the results - that is, to plot each one using the
previous one as a baseline, so the top line gives a sum of all
the data sets. It&#8217;s easier to try than to explain :-)</p>
<p>Once a data set is in the list, one can also perform certain
actions on it. For example, one can edit the
data set&#8217;s parameters (name, frequency etc.) if it&#8217;s one you
created or if you are an administrator.</p>
<p>Once you are happy, click Chart This List to see the chart.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-new-data-sets">
<span id="charts-new-series"></span><h4>Creating New Data Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-new-data-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>You may also create new data sets of your own. To do this,
click the &#8220;create a new data set&#8221; link on the Create Chart page.
This takes you to a search-like interface where you can define
the search that Bugzilla will plot. At the bottom of the page,
you choose the category, sub-category and name of your new
data set.</p>
<p>If you have sufficient permissions, you can make the data set public,
and reduce the frequency of data collection to less than the default
seven days.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flags">
<span id="id23"></span><h2>Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A flag is a kind of status that can be set on bugs or attachments
to indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state.
Each installation can define its own set of flags that can be set
on bugs or attachments.</p>
<p>If your installation has defined a flag, you can set or unset that flag,
and if your administrator has enabled requesting of flags, you can submit
a request for another user to set the flag.</p>
<p>To set a flag, select either &#8220;+&#8221; or &#8220;-&#8221; from the drop-down menu next to
the name of the flag in the &#8220;Flags&#8221; list.  The meaning of these values are
flag-specific and thus cannot be described in this documentation,
but by way of example, setting a flag named &#8220;review&#8221; to &#8220;+&#8221; may indicate
that the bug/attachment has passed review, while setting it to &#8220;-&#8221;
may indicate that the bug/attachment has failed review.</p>
<p>To unset a flag, click its drop-down menu and select the blank value.
Note that marking an attachment as obsolete automatically cancels all
pending requests for the attachment.</p>
<p>If your administrator has enabled requests for a flag, request a flag
by selecting &#8221;?&#8221; from the drop-down menu and then entering the username
of the user you want to set the flag in the text field next to the menu.</p>
<p>A set flag appears in bug reports and on &#8220;edit attachment&#8221; pages with the
abbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the
flag name. For example, if Jack sets a &#8220;review&#8221; flag to &#8220;+&#8221;, it appears
as Jack: review [ + ]</p>
<p>A requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended
to the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag
appended to the flag name within parentheses.  For example, if Jack
asks Jill for review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).</p>
<p>You can browse through open requests made of you and by you by selecting
&#8216;My Requests&#8217; from the footer. You can also look at open requests limited
by other requesters, requestees, products, components, and flag names from
this page. Note that you can use &#8216;-&#8216; for requestee to specify flags with
&#8216;no requestee&#8217; set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="whining">
<span id="id24"></span><h2>Whining<a class="headerlink" href="#whining" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Whining is a feature in Bugzilla that can regularly annoy users at
specified times.  Using this feature, users can execute saved searches
at specific times (i.e. the 15th of the month at midnight) or at
regular intervals (i.e. every 15 minutes on Sundays).  The results of the
searches are sent to the user, either as a single email or as one email
per bug, along with some descriptive text.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Throughout this section it will be assumed that all users are members
of the bz_canusewhines group, membership in which is required in order
to use the Whining system.  You can easily make all users members of
the bz_canusewhines group by setting the User RegExp to &#8221;.*&#8221; (without
the quotes).
Also worth noting is the bz_canusewhineatothers group.  Members of this
group can create whines for any user or group in Bugzilla using a
extended form of the whining interface.  Features only available to
members of the bz_canusewhineatothers group will be noted in the
appropriate places.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-event">
<span id="whining-overview"></span><h3>The Event<a class="headerlink" href="#the-event" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The whining system defines an &#8220;Event&#8221; as one or more queries being
executed at regular intervals, with the results of said queries (if
there are any) being emailed to the user.  Events are created by
clicking on the &#8220;Add new event&#8221; button.</p>
<p>Once a new event is created, the first thing to set is the &#8220;Email
subject line&#8221;.  The contents of this field will be used in the subject
line of every email generated by this event.  In addition to setting a
subject, space is provided to enter some descriptive text that will be
included at the top of each message (to help you in understanding why
you received the email in the first place).</p>
<p>The next step is to specify when the Event is to be run (the Schedule)
and what searches are to be performed (the Searches).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="whining-schedule">
<span id="id25"></span><h3>Whining Schedule<a class="headerlink" href="#whining-schedule" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each whining event is associated with zero or more schedules.  A
schedule is used to specify when the search (specified below) is to be
run.  A new event starts out with no schedules (which means it will
never run, as it is not scheduled to run).  To add a schedule, press
the &#8220;Add a new schedule&#8221; button.</p>
<p>Each schedule includes an interval, which you use to tell Bugzilla
when the event should be run.  An event can be run on certain days of
the week, certain days of the month, during weekdays (defined as
Monday through Friday), or every day.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Be careful if you set your event to run on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of
the month, as your event may not run exactly when expected.  If you
want your event to run on the last day of the month, select &#8220;Last day
of the month&#8221; as the interval.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have specified the day(s) on which the event is to be run, you
should now specify the time at which the event is to be run.  You can
have the event run at a certain hour on the specified day(s), or
every hour, half-hour, or quarter-hour on the specified day(s).</p>
<p>If a single schedule does not execute an event as many times as you
would want, you can create another schedule for the same event.  For
example, if you want to run an event on days whose numbers are
divisible by seven, you would need to add four schedules to the event,
setting the schedules to run on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th (one day
per schedule) at whatever time (or times) you choose.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you are a member of the bz_canusewhineatothers group, then you
will be presented with another option: &#8220;Mail to&#8221;.  Using this you
can control who will receive the emails generated by this event.  You
can choose to send the emails to a single user (identified by email
address) or a single group (identified by group name).  To send to
multiple users or groups, create a new schedule for each additional
user/group.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="whining-searches">
<span id="whining-query"></span><h3>Whining Searches<a class="headerlink" href="#whining-searches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each whining event is associated with zero or more searches.  A search
is any saved search to be run as part of the specified schedule (see
above).  You start out without any searches associated with the event
(which means that the event will not run, as there will never be any
results to return).  To add a search, press the &#8220;Add a search&#8221; button.</p>
<p>The first field to examine in your newly added search is the Sort field.
Searches are run, and results included, in the order specified by the
Sort field.  Searches with smaller Sort values will run before searches
with bigger Sort values.</p>
<p>The next field to examine is the Search field.  This is where you
choose the actual search that is to be run.  Instead of defining search
parameters here, you are asked to choose from the list of saved
searches (the same list that appears at the bottom of every Bugzilla
page).  You are only allowed to choose from searches that you have
saved yourself (the default saved search, &#8220;My Bugs&#8221;, is not a valid
choice).  If you do not have any saved searches, you can take this
opportunity to create one (see <a class="reference internal" href="#list"><em>Bug Lists</em></a>).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">When running searches, the whining system acts as if you are the user
executing the search.  This means that the whining system will ignore
bugs that match your search, but that you cannot access.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have chosen the saved search to be executed, give the search a
descriptive title.  This title will appear in the email, above the
results of the search.  If you choose &#8220;One message per bug&#8221;, the search
title will appear at the top of each email that contains a bug matching
your search.</p>
<p>Finally, decide if the results of the search should be sent in a single
email, or if each bug should appear in its own email.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Think carefully before checking the &#8220;One message per bug&#8221; box.  If

<div class="section" id="saving-your-changes">
<h3>Saving Your Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-your-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once you have defined at least one schedule, and created at least one
search, go ahead and &#8220;Update/Commit&#8221;.  This will save your Event and make
it available for immediate execution.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you ever feel like deleting your event, you may do so using the
