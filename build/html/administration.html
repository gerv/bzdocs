<span id="parameters"></span><h2>Bugzilla Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#bugzilla-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Bugzilla is configured by changing various parameters, accessed
from the &#8220;Parameters&#8221; link in the Administration page (the
Administration page can be found by clicking the &#8220;Administration&#8221;
link in the footer). The parameters are divided into several categories,
accessed via the menu on the left. Following is a description of the
different categories and important parameters within those categories.</p>
<div class="section" id="required-settings">
<span id="param-requiredsettings"></span><h3>Required Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#required-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The core required parameters for any Bugzilla installation are set
here. These parameters must be set before a new Bugzilla installation
can be used. Administrators should review this list before
deploying a new Bugzilla installation.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>maintainer</dt>
<dd>Email address of the person
responsible for maintaining this Bugzilla installation.
The address need not be that of a valid Bugzilla account.</dd>
<dt>urlbase</dt>
<dd>Defines the fully qualified domain name and web
server path to this Bugzilla installation.
For example, if the Bugzilla query page is
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/query.cgi</span></tt>,
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">urlbase</span></tt> should be set
to <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>docs_urlbase</dt>
<dd>Defines path to the Bugzilla documentation. This can be a fully
qualified domain name, or a path relative to &#8220;urlbase&#8221;.
For example, if the &#8220;Bugzilla Configuration&#8221; page
of the documentation is
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/docs/html/parameters.html</span></tt>,
set the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">docs_urlbase</span></tt>
to <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/docs/html/</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>sslbase</dt>
<dd>Defines the fully qualified domain name and web
server path for HTTPS (SSL) connections to this Bugzilla installation.
For example, if the Bugzilla main page is
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://www.foo.com/bugzilla/index.cgi</span></tt>,
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sslbase</span></tt> should be set
to <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://www.foo.com/bugzilla/</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>ssl_redirect</dt>
<dd>If enabled, Bugzilla will force HTTPS (SSL) connections, by
automatically redirecting any users who try to use a non-SSL
connection.</dd>
<dt>cookiedomain</dt>
<dd>Defines the domain for Bugzilla cookies. This is typically left blank.
If there are multiple hostnames that point to the same webserver, which
require the same cookie, then this parameter can be utilized. For
example, If your website is at
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://www.foo.com/</span></tt>, setting this to
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.foo.com/</span></tt> will also allow
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">bar.foo.com/</span></tt> to access Bugzilla cookies.</dd>
<dt>cookiepath</dt>
<dd>Defines a path, relative to the web server root, that Bugzilla
cookies will be restricted to. For example, if the
<strong class="command">urlbase</strong> is set to
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/</span></tt>, the
<strong class="command">cookiepath</strong> should be set to
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">/bugzilla/</span></tt>. Setting it to &#8220;/&#8221; will allow all sites
served by this web server or virtual host to read Bugzilla cookies.</dd>
<dt>utf8</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Determines whether to use UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding for all text in
Bugzilla. New installations should set this to true to avoid character
encoding problems. Existing databases should set this to true only
after the data has been converted from existing legacy character
encoding to UTF-8, using the
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">contrib/recode.pl</span></tt> script.
.. note:: If you turn this parameter from &#8220;off&#8221; to &#8220;on&#8221;, you must re-run</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">checksetup.pl</span></tt> immediately afterward.</div></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>shutdownhtml</dt>
<dd><p class="first">If there is any text in this field, this Bugzilla installation will
be completely disabled and this text will appear instead of all
Bugzilla pages for all users, including Admins. Used in the event
of site maintenance or outage situations.
.. note:: Although regular log-in capability is disabled while</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><strong class="command">shutdownhtml</strong>
is enabled, safeguards are in place to protect the unfortunate
admin who loses connection to Bugzilla. Should this happen to you,
go directly to the <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">editparams.cgi</span></tt> (by typing
the URL in manually, if necessary). Doing this will prompt you to
log in, and your name/password will be accepted here (but nowhere
else).</div></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>announcehtml</dt>
<dd>Any text in this field will be displayed at the top of every HTML
page in this Bugzilla installation. The text is not wrapped in any
tags. For best results, wrap the text in a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;div&gt;</span></tt>
tag. Any style attributes from the CSS can be applied. For example,
to make the text green inside of a red box, add <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">id=message</span></tt>
to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;div&gt;</span></tt> tag.</dd>
<dt>proxy_url</dt>
<dd>If this Bugzilla installation is behind a proxy, enter the proxy
information here to enable Bugzilla to access the Internet. Bugzilla
requires Internet access to utilize the
<strong class="command">upgrade_notification</strong> parameter (below). If the
proxy requires authentication, use the syntax:
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://user:pass&#64;proxy_url/</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>upgrade_notification</dt>
<dd>Enable or disable a notification on the homepage of this Bugzilla
installation when a newer version of Bugzilla is available. This
notification is only visible to administrators. Choose &#8220;disabled&#8221;,
to turn off the notification. Otherwise, choose which version of
Bugzilla you want to be notified about: &#8220;development_snapshot&#8221; is the
latest release on the trunk; &#8220;latest_stable_release&#8221; is the most
recent release available on the most recent stable branch;
&#8220;stable_branch_release&#8221; the most recent release on the branch
this installation is based on.</dd>

<div class="section" id="administrative-policies">
<span id="param-admin-policies"></span><h3>Administrative Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#administrative-policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This page contains parameters for basic administrative functions.
Options include whether to allow the deletion of bugs and users,
and whether to allow users to change their email address.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="user-authentication">
<span id="param-user-authentication"></span><h3>User Authentication<a class="headerlink" href="#user-authentication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This page contains the settings that control how this Bugzilla
installation will do its authentication. Choose what authentication
mechanism to use (the Bugzilla database, or an external source such
as LDAP), and set basic behavioral parameters. For example, choose
whether to require users to login to browse bugs, the management
of authentication cookies, and the regular expression used to
validate email addresses. Some parameters are highlighted below.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>emailregexp</dt>
<dd>Defines the regular expression used to validate email addresses
used for login names. The default attempts to match fully
qualified email addresses (i.e. <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'user&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;com">'user<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>com</a>&#8216;) in a slightly
more restrictive way than what is allowed in RFC 2822.
Some Bugzilla installations allow only local user names (i.e &#8216;user&#8217;
instead of <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'user&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;com">'user<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>com</a>&#8216;). In that case, this parameter
should be used to define the email domain.</dd>
<dt>emailsuffix</dt>
<dd>This string is appended to login names when actually sending
email to a user. For example,
If <strong class="command">emailregexp</strong> has been set to allow
local usernames,
then this parameter would contain the email domain for all users
(i.e. <a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;com">'<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>com</a>&#8216;).</dd>

</div>
<div class="section" id="attachments">
<span id="param-attachments"></span><h3>Attachments<a class="headerlink" href="#attachments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This page allows for setting restrictions and other parameters
regarding attachments to bugs. For example, control size limitations
and whether to allow pointing to external files via a URI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bug-change-policies">
<span id="param-bug-change-policies"></span><h3>Bug Change Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-change-policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Set policy on default behavior for bug change events. For example,
choose which status to set a bug to when it is marked as a duplicate,
and choose whether to allow bug reporters to set the priority or
target milestone. Also allows for configuration of what changes
should require the user to make a comment, described below.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>commenton*</dt>
<dd><p class="first">All these fields allow you to dictate what changes can pass
without comment, and which must have a comment from the
person who changed them.  Often, administrators will allow
users to add themselves to the CC list, accept bugs, or
change the Status Whiteboard without adding a comment as to
their reasons for the change, yet require that most other
changes come with an explanation.
Set the &#8220;commenton&#8221; options according to your site policy. It
is a wise idea to require comments when users resolve, reassign, or
reopen bugs at the very least.
.. note:: It is generally far better to require a developer comment</p>
<blockquote class="last">
<div>when resolving bugs than not. Few things are more annoying to bug
database users than having a developer mark a bug &#8220;fixed&#8221; without
any comment as to what the fix was (or even that it was truly
fixed!)</div></blockquote>
</dd>
<dt>noresolveonopenblockers</dt>
<dd>This option will prevent users from resolving bugs as FIXED if
they have unresolved dependencies. Only the FIXED resolution
is affected. Users will be still able to resolve bugs to
resolutions other than FIXED if they have unresolved dependent
bugs.</dd>

</div>
<div class="section" id="bug-fields">
<span id="param-bugfields"></span><h3>Bug Fields<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-fields" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The parameters in this section determine the default settings of
several Bugzilla fields for new bugs, and also control whether
certain fields are used. For example, choose whether to use the
&#8220;target milestone&#8221; field or the &#8220;status whiteboard&#8221; field.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>useqacontact</dt>
<dd>This allows you to define an email address for each component,
in addition to that of the default assignee, who will be sent
carbon copies of incoming bugs.</dd>
<dt>usestatuswhiteboard</dt>
<dd>This defines whether you wish to have a free-form, overwritable field
associated with each bug. The advantage of the Status Whiteboard is
that it can be deleted or modified with ease, and provides an
easily-searchable field for indexing some bugs that have some trait
in common.</dd>

</div>
<div class="section" id="bug-moving">
<span id="param-bugmoving"></span><h3>Bug Moving<a class="headerlink" href="#bug-moving" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This page controls whether this Bugzilla installation allows certain
users to move bugs to an external database. If bug moving is enabled,
there are a number of parameters that control bug moving behaviors.
For example, choose which users are allowed to move bugs, the location
of the external database, and the default product and component that
bugs moved <em>from</em> other bug databases to this
Bugzilla installation are assigned to.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dependency-graphs">
<span id="param-dependency-graphs"></span><h3>Dependency Graphs<a class="headerlink" href="#dependency-graphs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This page has one parameter that sets the location of a Web Dot
server, or of the Web Dot binary on the local system, that is used
to generate dependency graphs. Web Dot is a CGI program that creates
images from <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">.dot</span></tt> graphic description files. If
no Web Dot server or binary is specified, then dependency graphs will
be disabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="group-security">
<span id="param-group-security"></span><h3>Group Security<a class="headerlink" href="#group-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bugzilla allows for the creation of different groups, with the
ability to restrict the visibility of bugs in a group to a set of
specific users. Specific products can also be associated with
groups, and users restricted to only see products in their groups.
Several parameters are described in more detail below. Most of the
configuration of groups and their relationship to products is done
on the &#8220;Groups&#8221; and &#8220;Product&#8221; pages of the &#8220;Administration&#8221; area.
The options on this page control global default behavior.
For more information on Groups and Group Security, see
<a class="reference internal" href="#groups"><em>Groups and Group Security</em></a></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>makeproductgroups</dt>
<dd>Determines whether or not to automatically create groups
when new products are created. If this is on, the groups will be
used for querying bugs.</dd>
<dt>usevisibilitygroups</dt>
<dd>If selected, user visibility will be restricted to members of
groups, as selected in the group configuration settings.
Each user-defined group can be allowed to see members of selected
other groups.
For details on configuring groups (including the visibility
restrictions) see <a class="reference internal" href="#edit-groups"><em>Editing Groups and Assigning Group Permissions</em></a>.</dd>
<dt>querysharegroup</dt>
<dd>The name of the group of users who are allowed to share saved
searches with one another. For more information on using
saved searches, see <a class="reference internal" href="using.html#savedsearches"><em>Saved Searches</em></a>.</dd>

<div class="section" id="ldap-authentication">
<span id="bzldap"></span><h3>LDAP Authentication<a class="headerlink" href="#ldap-authentication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>LDAP authentication is a module for Bugzilla&#8217;s plugin
authentication architecture. This page contains all the parameters
necessary to configure Bugzilla for use with LDAP authentication.</p>
<p>The existing authentication
scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses as the primary user ID, and a
password to authenticate that user. All places within Bugzilla that
require a user ID (e.g assigning a bug) use the email
address. The LDAP authentication builds on top of this scheme, rather
than replacing it. The initial log-in is done with a username and
password for the LDAP directory. Bugzilla tries to bind to LDAP using
those credentials and, if successful, tries to map this account to a
Bugzilla account. If an LDAP mail attribute is defined, the value of this
attribute is used, otherwise the &#8220;emailsuffix&#8221; parameter is appended to LDAP
username to form a full email address. If an account for this address
already exists in the Bugzilla installation, it will log in to that account.
If no account for that email address exists, one is created at the time
of login. (In this case, Bugzilla will attempt to use the &#8220;displayName&#8221;
or &#8220;cn&#8221; attribute to determine the user&#8217;s full name.) After
authentication, all other user-related tasks are still handled by email
address, not LDAP username. For example, bugs are still assigned by
email address and users are still queried by email address.</p>
<p>Parameters required to use LDAP Authentication:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>user_verify_class</dt>
<dd>If you want to list <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LDAP</span></tt> here,
make sure to have set up the other parameters listed below.
Unless you have other (working) authentication methods listed as
well, you may otherwise not be able to log back in to Bugzilla once
you log out.
If this happens to you, you will need to manually edit
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">data/params</span></tt> and set user_verify_class to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DB</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>LDAPserver</dt>
<dd><p class="first">This parameter should be set to the name (and optionally the
port) of your LDAP server. If no port is specified, it assumes
the default LDAP port of 389.
For example: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ldap.company.com</span></tt>
or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ldap.company.com:3268</span></tt>
You can also specify a LDAP URI, so as to use other
protocols, such as LDAPS or LDAPI. If port was not specified in
the URI, the default is either 389 or 636 for &#8216;LDAP&#8217; and &#8216;LDAPS&#8217;
schemes respectively.
.. tip:: In order to use SSL with LDAP, specify a URI with &#8220;ldaps://&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>This will force the use of SSL over port 636.</div></blockquote>
<p class="last">For example, normal LDAP:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ldap://ldap.company.com</span></tt>, LDAP over SSL:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ldaps://ldap.company.com</span></tt> or LDAP over a UNIX
domain socket <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ldapi://%2fvar%2flib%2fldap_sock</span></tt>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>LDAPbinddn [Optional]</dt>
<dd>Some LDAP servers will not allow an anonymous bind to search
the directory. If this is the case with your configuration you
should set the LDAPbinddn parameter to the user account Bugzilla
should use instead of the anonymous bind.
Ex. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cn=default,cn=user:password</span></tt></dd>
<dt>LDAPBaseDN</dt>
<dd>The LDAPBaseDN parameter should be set to the location in
your LDAP tree that you would like to search for email addresses.
Your uids should be unique under the DN specified here.
Ex. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ou=People,o=Company</span></tt></dd>
<dt>LDAPuidattribute</dt>
<dd>The LDAPuidattribute parameter should be set to the attribute
which contains the unique UID of your users. The value retrieved
from this attribute will be used when attempting to bind as the
user to confirm their password.
Ex. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">uid</span></tt></dd>
<dt>LDAPmailattribute</dt>
<dd>The LDAPmailattribute parameter should be the name of the
attribute which contains the email address your users will enter
into the Bugzilla login boxes.
Ex. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mail</span></tt></dd>

<div class="section" id="radius-authentication">
<span id="bzradius"></span><h3>RADIUS Authentication<a class="headerlink" href="#radius-authentication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>RADIUS authentication is a module for Bugzilla&#8217;s plugin
authentication architecture. This page contains all the parameters
necessary for configuring Bugzilla to use RADIUS authentication.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Most caveats that apply to LDAP authentication apply to RADIUS

make sure to have set up the other parameters listed below.
Unless you have other (working) authentication methods listed as
well, you may otherwise not be able to log back in to Bugzilla once
you log out.
If this happens to you, you will need to manually edit
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">data/params</span></tt> and set user_verify_class to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DB</span></tt>.</dd>
<dt>RADIUS_server</dt>
<dd>This parameter should be set to the name (and optionally the
port) of your RADIUS server.</dd>
<dt>RADIUS_secret</dt>
<dd>This parameter should be set to the RADIUS server&#8217;s secret.</dd>
<dt>RADIUS_email_suffix</dt>
<dd>Bugzilla needs an e-mail address for each user account.
Therefore, it needs to determine the e-mail address corresponding
to a RADIUS user.
Bugzilla offers only a simple way to do this: it can concatenate
a suffix to the RADIUS user name to convert it into an e-mail
address.
You can specify this suffix in the RADIUS_email_suffix parameter.
If this simple solution does not work for you, you&#8217;ll
probably need to modify
<tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">Bugzilla/Auth/Verify/RADIUS.pm</span></tt> to match your
requirements.</dd>

query options are, what the &#8220;My Bugs&#8221; page returns, whether users
can freely add bugs to the quip list, and how many duplicate bugs are
needed to add a bug to the &#8220;most frequently reported&#8221; list.</p>

<div class="section" id="shadow-database">
<span id="param-shadowdatabase"></span><h3>Shadow Database<a class="headerlink" href="#shadow-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This page controls whether a shadow database is used, and all the
parameters associated with the shadow database. Versions of Bugzilla
prior to 3.2 used the MyISAM table type, which supports
only table-level write locking. With MyISAM, any time someone is making a change to
a bug, the entire table is locked until the write operation is complete.
Locking for write also blocks reads until the write is complete.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">shadowdb</span></tt> parameter was designed to get around
this limitation. While only a single user is allowed to write to
a table at a time, reads can continue unimpeded on a read-only
shadow copy of the database.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">As of version 3.2, Bugzilla no longer uses the MyISAM table type.
Instead, InnoDB is used, which can do transaction-based locking.
Therefore, the limitations the Shadow Database feature was designed
to workaround no longer exist.</p>

<div class="section" id="user-matching">
<span id="admin-usermatching"></span><h3>User Matching<a class="headerlink" href="#user-matching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The settings on this page control how users are selected and queried
when adding a user to a bug. For example, users need to be selected
when choosing who the bug is assigned to, adding to the CC list or
selecting a QA contact. With the &#8220;usemenuforusers&#8221; parameter, it is
possible to configure Bugzilla to
display a list of users in the fields instead of an empty text field.
This should only be used in Bugzilla installations with a small number
of users. If users are selected via a text box, this page also
contains parameters for how user names can be queried and matched
when entered.</p>
<p>Another setting called &#8216;ajax_user_autocompletion&#8217; enables certain
user fields to display a list of matched user names as a drop down after typing
a few characters. Note that it is recommended to use mod_perl when
enabling &#8216;ajax_user_autocompletion&#8217;.</p>

<p>The first screen is a search form to search for existing user
accounts. You can run searches based either on the user ID, real
name or login name (i.e. the email address, or just the first part
of the email address if the &#8220;emailsuffix&#8221; parameter is set).
The search can be conducted
in different ways using the listbox to the right of the text entry
box. You can match by case-insensitive substring (the default),
regular expression, a <em>reverse</em> regular expression
match (which finds every user name which does NOT match the regular
expression), or the exact string if you know exactly who you are
looking for. The search can be restricted to users who are in a
specific group. By default, the restriction is turned off.</p>
<p>The search returns a list of
users matching your criteria. User properties can be edited by clicking
the login name. The Account History of a user can be viewed by clicking
the &#8220;View&#8221; link in the Account History column. The Account History
displays changes that have been made to the user account, the time of
the change and the user who made the change. For example, the Account
History page will display details of when a user was added or removed

<li><p class="first"><em>Password</em>:
You can change the user&#8217;s password here. Users can automatically
request a new password, so you shouldn&#8217;t need to do this often.
If you want to disable an account, see Disable Text below.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Bugmail Disabled</em>:

<p>Group Access Controls are an important aspect of using groups for
isolating products and restricting access to bugs filed against those
products. For more information on groups, including how to create, edit
add users to, and alter permission of, see <a class="reference internal" href="#groups"><em>Groups and Group Security</em></a>.</p>
<p>After selecting the &#8220;Edit Group Access Controls&#8221; link from the &#8220;Edit
Product&#8221; page, a table containing all user-defined groups for this
Bugzilla installation is displayed. The system groups that are created
when Bugzilla is installed are not applicable to Group Access Controls.
Below is description of what each of these fields means.</p>
<p>Groups may be applicable (e.g bugs in this product can be associated
with this group) , default (e.g. bugs in this product are in this group
by default), and mandatory (e.g. bugs in this product must be associated
with this group) for each product. Groups can also control access
to bugs for a given product, or be used to make bugs for a product
totally read-only unless the group restrictions are met. The best way to
understand these relationships is by example. See
<a class="reference internal" href="#group-control-examples"><em>Common Applications of Group Controls</em></a> for examples of
product and group relationships.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Products and Groups are not limited to a one-to-one relationship.
Multiple groups can be associated with the same product, and groups
can be associated with more than one product.</p>
</div>
<p>If any group has <em>Entry</em> selected, then the
product will restrict bug entry to only those users
who are members of <em>all</em> the groups with
<em>Entry</em> selected.</p>
<p>If any group has <em>Canedit</em> selected,
then the product will be read-only for any users
who are not members of <em>all</em> of the groups with
<em>Canedit</em> selected. <em>Only</em> users who
are members of all the <em>Canedit</em> groups
will be able to edit bugs for this product. This is an additional
restriction that enables finer-grained control over products rather
than just all-or-nothing access levels.</p>
<p>The following settings let you
choose privileges on a <em>per-product basis</em>.
This is a convenient way to give privileges to
some users for some products only, without having
to give them global privileges which would affect
all products.</p>
<p>Any group having <em>editcomponents</em>
selected  allows users who are in this group to edit all
aspects of this product, including components, milestones
and versions.</p>
<p>Any group having <em>canconfirm</em> selected
allows users who are in this group to confirm bugs
in this product.</p>
<p>Any group having <em>editbugs</em> selected allows
users who are in this group to edit all fields of
bugs in this product.</p>
<p>The <em>MemberControl</em> and
<em>OtherControl</em> are used in tandem to determine which
bugs will be placed in this group. The only allowable combinations of
these two parameters are listed in a table on the &#8220;Edit Group Access Controls&#8221;
page. Consult this table for details on how these fields can be used.
Examples of different uses are described below.</p>
<div class="section" id="common-applications-of-group-controls">
<span id="group-control-examples"></span><h4>Common Applications of Group Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#common-applications-of-group-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The use of groups is best explained by providing examples that illustrate
configurations for common use cases. The examples follow a common syntax:
<em>Group: Entry, MemberControl, OtherControl, CanEdit,
EditComponents, CanConfirm, EditBugs</em>. Where &#8220;Group&#8221; is the name
of the group being edited for this product. The other fields all
correspond to the table on the &#8220;Edit Group Access Controls&#8221; page. If any
of these options are not listed, it means they are not checked.</p>
<p>Basic Product/Group Restriction</p>
<p>Suppose there is a product called &#8220;Bar&#8221;. The
&#8220;Bar&#8221; product can only have bugs entered against it by users in the
group &#8220;Foo&#8221;. Additionally, bugs filed against product &#8220;Bar&#8221; must stay
restricted to users to &#8220;Foo&#8221; at all times. Furthermore, only members
of group &#8220;Foo&#8221; can edit bugs filed against product &#8220;Bar&#8221;, even if other
users could see the bug. This arrangement would achieved by the
following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Product Bar:
foo: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY, CANEDIT</pre>
</div>
<p>Perhaps such strict restrictions are not needed for product &#8220;Bar&#8221;. A
more lenient way to configure product &#8220;Bar&#8221; and group &#8220;Foo&#8221; would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Product Bar:
foo: ENTRY, SHOWN/SHOWN, EDITCOMPONENTS, CANCONFIRM, EDITBUGS</pre>
</div>
<p>The above indicates that for product &#8220;Bar&#8221;, members of group &#8220;Foo&#8221; can
enter bugs. Any one with permission to edit a bug against product &#8220;Bar&#8221;
can put the bug
in group &#8220;Foo&#8221;, even if they themselves are not in &#8220;Foo&#8221;. Anyone in group
&#8220;Foo&#8221; can edit all aspects of the components of product &#8220;Bar&#8221;, can confirm
bugs against product &#8220;Bar&#8221;, and can edit all fields of any bug against
product &#8220;Bar&#8221;.</p>
<p>General User Access With Security Group</p>
<p>To permit any user to file bugs against &#8220;Product A&#8221;,
and to permit any user to submit those bugs into a
group called &#8220;Security&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Product A:
security: SHOWN/SHOWN</pre>
</div>
<p>General User Access With A Security Product</p>
<p>To permit any user to file bugs against product called &#8220;Security&#8221;
while keeping those bugs from becoming visible to anyone
outside the group &#8220;SecurityWorkers&#8221; (unless a member of the
&#8220;SecurityWorkers&#8221; group removes that restriction):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Product Security:
securityworkers: DEFAULT/MANDATORY</pre>
</div>
<p>Product Isolation With a Common Group</p>
<p>To permit users of &#8220;Product A&#8221; to access the bugs for
&#8220;Product A&#8221;, users of &#8220;Product B&#8221; to access the bugs for
&#8220;Product B&#8221;, and support staff, who are members of the &#8220;Support
Group&#8221; to access both, three groups are needed:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Support Group: Contains members of the support staff.</li>
<li>AccessA Group: Contains users of product A and the Support group.</li>
<li>AccessB Group: Contains users of product B and the Support group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once these three groups are defined, the product group controls
can be set to:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Product A:
AccessA: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Product B:
AccessB: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY</pre>
</div>
<p>Perhaps the &#8220;Support Group&#8221; wants more control. For example,
the &#8220;Support Group&#8221;  could be permitted to make bugs inaccessible to
users of both groups &#8220;AccessA&#8221; and &#8220;AccessB&#8221;.
Then, the &#8220;Support Group&#8221; could be permitted to publish
bugs relevant to all users in a third product (let&#8217;s call it
&#8220;Product Common&#8221;) that is read-only
to anyone outside the &#8220;Support Group&#8221;. In this way the &#8220;Support Group&#8221;
could control bugs that should be seen by both groups.
That configuration would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Product A:
AccessA: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Support: SHOWN/NA
Product B:
AccessB: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Support: SHOWN/NA
Product Common:
Support: ENTRY, DEFAULT/MANDATORY, CANEDIT</pre>
</div>
<p>Make a Product Read Only</p>
<p>Sometimes a product is retired and should no longer have
new bugs filed against it (for example, an older version of a software
product that is no longer supported). A product can be made read-only
by creating a group called &#8220;readonly&#8221; and adding products to the
group as needed:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>Product A:
ReadOnly: ENTRY, NA/NA, CANEDIT</pre>

<div class="section" id="components">
<span id="id4"></span><h2>Components<a class="headerlink" href="#components" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Components are subsections of a Product. E.g. the computer game
you are designing may have a &#8220;UI&#8221;
component, an &#8220;API&#8221; component, a &#8220;Sound System&#8221; component, and a
&#8220;Plugins&#8221; component, each overseen by a different programmer. It
often makes sense to divide Components in Bugzilla according to the
natural divisions of responsibility within your Product or
company.</p>
<p>Each component has a default assignee and (if you turned it on in the parameters),
a QA Contact. The default assignee should be the primary person who fixes bugs in
that component. The QA Contact should be the person who will ensure
these bugs are completely fixed. The Assignee, QA Contact, and Reporter
will get email when new bugs are created in this Component and when
these bugs change. Default Assignee and Default QA Contact fields only
dictate the
<em>default assignments</em>;
these can be changed on bug submission, or at any later point in
a bug&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>To create a new Component:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Component</span> <span class="pre">Description</span></tt> field may contain a
limited subset of HTML tags. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Default</span> <span class="pre">Assignee</span></tt>

<p>Milestones are &#8220;targets&#8221; that you plan to get a bug fixed by. For

would be assigned the milestone of 3.0.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

can optionally set the &#8220;sortkey&#8221;, which is a positive or negative
number (-32768 to 32767) that defines where in the list this particular
milestone appears. This is because milestones often do not
occur in alphanumeric order For example, &#8220;Future&#8221; might be
after &#8220;Release 1.2&#8221;. Select &#8220;Add&#8221;.</li>

<div class="section" id="flags">
<span id="flags-overview"></span><h2>Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Flags are a way to attach a specific status to a bug or attachment,
either <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt>. The meaning of these symbols depends on the text
the flag itself, but contextually they could mean pass/fail,
accept/reject, approved/denied, or even a simple yes/no. If your site
allows requestable flags, then users may set a flag to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt> as a
request to another user that they look at the bug/attachment, and set
the flag to its correct status.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-simple-example">
<span id="flags-simpleexample"></span><h3>A Simple Example<a class="headerlink" href="#a-simple-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A developer might want to ask their manager,

They might want to do this for a <em>lot</em> of bugs,
so it would be nice to streamline the process...</p>
<p>In Bugzilla, it would work this way:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Bugzilla administrator creates a flag type called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blocking2.0</span></tt> that shows up on all bugs in
your product.
It shows up on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Show</span> <span class="pre">Bug</span></tt> screen
as the text <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blocking2.0</span></tt> with a drop-down box next
to it. The drop-down box contains four values: an empty space,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></tt>.</li>
<li>The developer sets the flag to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt>.</li>
<li>The manager sees the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">blocking2.0</span></tt>
flag with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt> value.</li>
<li>If the manager thinks the feature should go into the product
before version 2.0 can be released, he sets the flag to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></tt>. Otherwise, he sets it to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Now, every Bugzilla user who looks at the bug knows whether or
not the bug needs to be fixed before release of version 2.0.</li>

<p>Actually, there&#8217;s a fourth value a flag can have &#8211;

</div>
<div class="section" id="using-flag-requests">
<span id="flag-askto"></span><h3>Using flag requests<a class="headerlink" href="#using-flag-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If a flag has been defined as &#8216;requestable&#8217;, and a user has enough privileges
to request it (see below), the user can set the flag&#8217;s status to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt>.
This status indicates that someone (a.k.a. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">requester</span></tt>) is asking

<p>If a flag has been defined as &#8216;specifically requestable&#8217;,
a text box will appear next to the flag into which the requester may
enter a Bugzilla username. That named person (a.k.a. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">requestee</span></tt>)
will receive an email notifying them of the request, and pointing them
to the bug/attachment in question.</p>
<p>If a flag has <em>not</em> been defined as &#8216;specifically requestable&#8217;,
then no such text-box will appear. A request to set this flag cannot be made of
any specific individual, but must be asked <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">wind</span></tt>.

<span id="flag-types"></span><h3>Two Types of Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#two-types-of-flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<div class="section" id="attachment-flags">
<span id="flag-type-attachment"></span><h4>Attachment Flags<a class="headerlink" href="#attachment-flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Attachment flags are used to ask a question about a specific
attachment on a bug.</p>
<p>Many Bugzilla installations use this to
request that one developer <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">review</span></tt> another
developer&#8217;s code before they check it in. They attach the code to
a bug report, and then set a flag on that attachment called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">review</span></tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">review?boss&#64;domain.com</span></tt>.
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:boss&#37;&#52;&#48;domain&#46;com">boss<span>&#64;</span>domain<span>&#46;</span>com</a> is then notified by email that
he has to check out that attachment and approve it or deny it.</p>
<p>For a Bugzilla user, attachment flags show up in three places:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>On the list of attachments in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Show</span> <span class="pre">Bug</span></tt>
screen, you can see the current state of any flags that
have been set to ?, +, or -. You can see who asked about
the flag (the requester), and who is being asked (the
requestee).</li>
<li>When you <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Edit</span></tt> an attachment, you can
see any settable flag, along with any flags that have
already been set. This <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Edit</span> <span class="pre">Attachment</span></tt>
screen is where you set flags to ?, -, +, or unset them.</li>
<li>Requests are listed in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Request</span> <span class="pre">Queue</span></tt>, which

</div>
<div class="section" id="description">
<span id="flags-create-field-description"></span><h5>Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The description describes the flag in more detail. It is visible

</div>
<div class="section" id="category">
<span id="flags-create-field-category"></span><h5>Category<a class="headerlink" href="#category" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Default behaviour for a newly-created flag is to appear on
products and all components, which is why <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__Any__:__Any__</span></tt>
is already entered in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Inclusions</span></tt> box.
If this is not your desired behaviour, you must either set some
exclusions (for products on which you don&#8217;t want the flag to appear),
or you must remove <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__Any__:__Any__</span></tt> from the Inclusions box
and define products/components specifically for this flag.</p>
<p>To create an Inclusion, select a Product from the top drop-down box.
You may also select a specific component from the bottom drop-down box.
(Setting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__Any__</span></tt> for Product translates to,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">products</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">this</span> <span class="pre">Bugzilla</span></tt>.
Selecting  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__Any__</span></tt> in the Component field means
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">all</span> <span class="pre">components</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">selected</span> <span class="pre">product.</span></tt>)
Selections made, press <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Include</span></tt>, and your
Product/Component pairing will show up in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Inclusions</span></tt> box on the right.</p>
<p>To create an Exclusion, the process is the same; select a Product from the
top drop-down box, select a specific component if you want one, and press
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Exclude</span></tt>. The Product/Component pairing will show up in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Exclusions</span></tt> box on the right.</p>
<p>This flag <em>will</em> and <em>can</em> be set for any
products/components that appearing in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Inclusions</span></tt> box
(or which fall under the appropriate <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__Any__</span></tt>).
This flag <em>will not</em> appear (and therefore cannot be set) on
any products appearing in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Exclusions</span></tt> box.
<em>IMPORTANT: Exclusions override inclusions.</em></p>
<p>You may select a Product without selecting a specific Component,
but you can&#8217;t select a Component without a Product, or to select a
Component that does not belong to the named Product. If you do so,
Bugzilla will display an error message, even if all your products
have a component by that name.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Let&#8217;s say you have a product called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Jet</span> <span class="pre">Plane</span></tt> that has thousands of components. You want
to be able to ask if a problem should be fixed in the next model of
plane you release. We&#8217;ll call the flag <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fixInNext</span></tt>.
But, there&#8217;s one component in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Jet</span> <span class="pre">Plane,</span></tt>
called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Pilot.</span></tt> It doesn&#8217;t make sense to release a
new pilot, so you don&#8217;t want to have the flag show up in that component.
So, you include <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Jet</span> <span class="pre">Plane:__Any__</span></tt> and you exclude
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Jet</span> <span class="pre">Plane:Pilot</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sort-key">
<span id="flags-create-field-sortkey"></span><h5>Sort Key<a class="headerlink" href="#sort-key" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Flags normally show up in alphabetical order. If you want them to
show up in a different order, you can use this key set the order on each flag.
Flags with a lower sort key will appear before flags with a higher
sort key. Flags that have the same sort key will be sorted alphabetically,
but they will still be after flags with a lower sort key, and before flags
with a higher sort key.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> I have AFlag (Sort Key 100), BFlag (Sort Key 10),
CFlag (Sort Key 10), and DFlag (Sort Key 1). These show up in
the order: DFlag, BFlag, CFlag, AFlag.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="active">
<span id="flags-create-field-active"></span><h5>Active<a class="headerlink" href="#active" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Sometimes, you might want to keep old flag information in the
Bugzilla database, but stop users from setting any new flags of this type.
To do this, uncheck <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">active</span></tt>. Deactivated
flags will still show up in the UI if they are ?, +, or -, but they
may only be cleared (unset), and cannot be changed to a new value.
Once a deactivated flag is cleared, it will completely disappear from a
bug/attachment, and cannot be set again.</p>

<div class="section" id="requestable">
<span id="flags-create-field-requestable"></span><h5>Requestable<a class="headerlink" href="#requestable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>New flags are, by default, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">requestable</span></tt>, meaning that they
offer users the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">?</span></tt> option, as well as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-</span></tt>.
To remove the ? option, uncheck <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">requestable</span></tt>.</p>

<div class="section" id="specifically-requestable">
<span id="flags-create-field-specific"></span><h5>Specifically Requestable<a class="headerlink" href="#specifically-requestable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>By default this box is checked for new flags, meaning that users may make

text box next to a flag; if it is still requestable, then requests may
only be made <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">wind.</span></tt> Removing this after specific
requests have been made will not remove those requests; that data will

A company might have a policy stating all regressions
must be fixed by the next release - this keyword can make tracking those
bugs much easier.</p>
<p>Keywords are global, rather than per-product. If the administrator changes
a keyword currently applied to any bugs, the keyword cache must be rebuilt

be marked obsolete to prevent future usage.</p>
<p>Keywords can be created, edited or deleted by clicking the &#8220;Keywords&#8221;

<p>The release of Bugzilla 3.0 added the ability to create Custom Fields.
Custom Fields are treated like any other field - they can be set in bugs
and used for search queries. Administrators should keep in mind that
adding too many fields can make the user interface more complicated and
harder to use. Custom Fields should be added only when necessary and with
careful consideration.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">

<p>The following attributes must be set for each new custom field:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>Name:</em>
The name of the field in the database, used internally. This name

must be entered.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Field only appears when:</em>
A custom field can be made visible when some criteria is met.

<p>All of the code for voting in Bugzilla has been moved into an
extension, called &#8220;Voting&#8221;, in the <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">extensions/Voting/</span></tt>
directory. To enable it, you must remove the <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">disabled</span></tt>
file from that directory, and run <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">checksetup.pl</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Voting allows users to be given a pot of votes which they can allocate
to bugs, to indicate that they&#8217;d like them fixed.
This allows developers to gauge
user need for a particular enhancement or bugfix. By allowing bugs with
a certain number of votes to automatically move from &#8220;UNCONFIRMED&#8221; to
&#8220;CONFIRMED&#8221;, users of the bug system can help high-priority bugs garner
attention so they don&#8217;t sit for a long time awaiting triage.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Navigate to the &#8220;Edit product&#8221; screen for the Product you
wish to modify</li>
<li><em>Maximum Votes per person</em>:
Setting this field to &#8220;0&#8221; disables voting.</li>
<li><em>Maximum Votes a person can put on a single

<li><em>Number of votes a bug in this product needs to
automatically get out of the UNCONFIRMED state</em>:
Setting this field to &#8220;0&#8221; disables the automatic move of
bugs from UNCONFIRMED to CONFIRMED.</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="quips">
<span id="id11"></span><h2>Quips<a class="headerlink" href="#quips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Quips are small text messages that can be configured to appear
next to search results. A Bugzilla installation can have its own specific
quips. Whenever a quip needs to be displayed, a random selection
is made from the pool of already existing quips.</p>
<p>Quip submission is controlled by the <em>quip_list_entry_control</em>
parameter.  It has several possible values: open, moderated, or closed.
In order to enable quips approval you need to set this parameter to
&#8220;moderated&#8221;. In this way, users are free to submit quips for addition
but an administrator must explicitly approve them before they are
actually used.</p>
<p>In order to see the user interface for the quips, it is enough to click
on a quip when it is displayed together with the search results. Or
it can be seen directly in the browser by visiting the quips.cgi URL
(prefixed with the usual web location of the Bugzilla installation).
Once the quip interface is displayed, it is enough to click the
&#8220;view and edit the whole quip list&#8221; in order to see the administration
page. A page with all the quips available in the database will
be displayed.</p>
<p>Next to each quip there is a checkbox, under the
&#8220;Approved&#8221; column. Quips who have this checkbox checked are
already approved and will appear next to the search results.
The ones that have it unchecked are still preserved in the
database but they will not appear on search results pages.
User submitted quips have initially the checkbox unchecked.</p>
<p>Also, there is a delete link next to each quip,
which can be used in order to permanently delete a quip.</p>
<p>Display of quips is controlled by the <em>display_quips</em>
user preference.  Possible values are &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221;.</p>

<div class="section" id="groups-and-group-security">
<span id="groups"></span><h2>Groups and Group Security<a class="headerlink" href="#groups-and-group-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Groups allow for separating bugs into logical divisions.
Groups are typically used
to isolate bugs that should only be seen by certain people. For
example, a company might create a different group for each one of its customers
or partners. Group permissions could be set so that each partner or customer would
only have access to their own bugs. Or, groups might be used to create
variable access controls for different departments within an organization.
Another common use of groups is to associate groups with products,
creating isolation and access control on a per-product basis.</p>
<p>Groups and group behaviors are controlled in several places:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The group configuration page. To view or edit existing groups, or to
create new groups, access the &#8220;Groups&#8221; link from the &#8220;Administration&#8221;
page. This section of the manual deals primarily with the aspect of
group controls accessed on this page.</li>
<li>Global configuration parameters. Bugzilla has several parameters
that control the overall default group behavior and restriction
levels. For more information on the parameters that control
group behavior globally, see <a class="reference internal" href="#param-group-security"><em>Group Security</em></a>.</li>
<li>Product association with groups. Most of the functionality of groups
and group security is controlled at the product level. Some aspects
of group access controls for products are discussed in this section,
but for more detail see <a class="reference internal" href="#product-group-controls"><em>Assigning Group Controls to Products</em></a>.</li>
<li>Group access for users. See <a class="reference internal" href="#users-and-groups"><em>Assigning Users to Groups</em></a> for
details on how users are assigned group access.</li>
</ol>
<p>Group permissions are such that if a bug belongs to a group, only members
of that group can see the bug. If a bug is in more than one group, only
members of <em>all</em> the groups that the bug is in can see
the bug. For information on granting read-only access to certain people and
full edit access to others, see <a class="reference internal" href="#product-group-controls"><em>Assigning Group Controls to Products</em></a>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<p>A User can become a member of a group in several ways:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The user can be explicitly placed in the group by editing
the user&#8217;s profile. This can be done by accessing the &#8220;Users&#8221; page
from the &#8220;Administration&#8221; page. Use the search form to find the user
you want to edit group membership for, and click on their email
address in the search results to edit their profile. The profile
page lists all the groups, and indicates if the user is a member of
the group either directly or indirectly. More information on indirect
group membership is below. For more details on User administration,
see <a class="reference internal" href="#useradmin"><em>User Administration</em></a>.</li>
<li>The group can include another group of which the user is
a member. This is indicated by square brackets around the checkbox
next to the group name in the user&#8217;s profile.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#edit-groups"><em>Editing Groups and Assigning Group Permissions</em></a> for details on group inheritance.</li>
<li>The user&#8217;s email address can match the regular expression
that has been specified to automatically grant membership to
the group. This is indicated by &#8220;*&#8221; around the check box by the
group name in the user&#8217;s profile.
See <a class="reference internal" href="#create-groups"><em>Creating Groups</em></a> for details on
the regular expression option when creating groups.</li>

<h3>Assigning Group Controls to Products<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The primary functionality of groups is derived from the relationship of
groups to products. The concepts around segregating access to bugs with
product group controls can be confusing. For details and examples on this
topic, see <a class="reference internal" href="#product-group-controls"><em>Assigning Group Controls to Products</em></a>.</p>

<span id="sanitycheck"></span><h2>Checking and Maintaining Database Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-and-maintaining-database-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Over time it is possible for the Bugzilla database to become corrupt
or to have anomalies.
This could happen through normal usage of Bugzilla, manual database
administration outside of the Bugzilla user interface, or from some
other unexpected event. Bugzilla includes a &#8220;Sanity Check&#8221; script that
can perform several basic database checks, and repair certain problems or
inconsistencies.</p>
<p>To run the &#8220;Sanity Check&#8221; script, log in as an Administrator and click the
&#8220;Sanity Check&#8221; link in the admin page. Any problems that are found will be
displayed in red letters. If the script is capable of fixing a problem,
it will present a link to initiate the fix. If the script cannot
fix the problem it will require manual database administration or recovery.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Sanity Check&#8221; script can also be run from the command line via the perl
script <tt class="file docutils literal"><span class="pre">sanitycheck.pl</span></tt>. The script can also be run as
a <strong class="command">cron</strong> job. Results will be delivered by email.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Sanity Check&#8221; script should be run on a regular basis as a matter of
best practice.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">The &#8220;Sanity Check&#8221; script is no substitute for a competent database
administrator. It is only designed to check and repair basic database
problems.</p>
